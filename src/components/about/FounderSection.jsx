                or <strong className="text-[#222222]">(Aziz Jan)</strong> as he
                was popularly known, was a man of great virtue, character, and

                the foundation of what would become one of Pakistan's leading
                industrial conglomerates. His unwavering commitment to quality,
                integrity, and community service established the core values

                Haji Aziz-Ur-Rehman started his journey with modest means but
                extraordinary vision. He established the group's first match
                manufacturing unit in 1974, setting new standards for quality
                and safety in the industry. Through decades of hard work,
                perseverance, and strategic thinking, he transformed a single
                factory into a multi-divisional business empire spanning FMCG,
                textiles, board manufacturing, and real estate development.

                employees and community. He believed in creating opportunities
                for others and maintained the highest ethical standards in all
                business dealings. His teachings about honesty, hard work, and
                compassion remain the guiding principles of our group. His
                legacy lives on through our continued commitment to excellence,
                innovation, and serving the nation with quality products that
                touch millions of lives every day.
